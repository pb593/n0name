Since the times of antiquity, people have employed various mechanisms to secure information against disclosure to unintended parties. Middle Eastern scholars from as early as 600 BC are credited with the creation of substitution ciphers. The ancient Greek historian Herodotus left accounts of the use of steganographic techniques, such as hiding messages beneath a layer of wax or on a messenger's body. Other notable examples of ancient information security systems include hierogliphics, the Spartan scytale and the Caesar cipher. As the schemes for protecting information were getting more elaborate, so were the methods of breaking codes and ciphers. The Arab polymath Al-Kindi, who lived in the 800s AD, is known as the inventor of frequency analysis which remained one of the key techniques in cryptanalytics until the middle of the 20th century.

Largely fuelled by military and commercial applications, the competition between cryptographers and codebreakers was accelerating as humanity made technological progress. Movable type printing was invented in China around 1000 AD which made it possible to print text at a large scale. The Renaissance period in Europe was marked by the impetuous development of cryptography, including the invention of the first mechanical cipher machine by Leon Batista Aberti and the discovery of the Vigen\`{e}re cipher by Blaise de Vigen\`{e}re. The 19th century and the indusrial revolution brought us the telegraph, the Morse code and the famous laws of cryptography by the Dutch mathematician Auguste Kerckhoff.

The 20th century was the time of global wars and military conflicts which provided an additional impulse to the development of information security systems. During World War I, the stream cipher and the one-time pad were developed and used for the first time. World War II involved the use of advanced electromechanical cryptographic systems by all of the sides, with the British team of cryptologists headed by John Harper famously breaking the German Enigma cipher helping the Allied powers secure the victory. During the subsequent Cold War, the adversaries were making extensive use of electronic intelligence which led to the development of some of the cyptographic primitives that we use nowadays, including Feistel network block ciphers, Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol and RSA public key encryption. 

With the advent of the Internet which provided means to communicate electronically on a global scale, the demand for information security systems skyrocketed as a result of the expansion of its user base from government and military officials to businesses and ordinary people. The era of global information brought many opportunities, but was also marked by the use of information technology for malicious purposes, with cybercrime costing billions to the world economy every year. The shift to mobile computing in the 2000s meant that people were now using computers for a wider range of everyday tasks which allowed them to become more productive, but also made them more vulnerable to cyberattacks and surveillance. The 2013 revelations made by Edward Snowden suggest that governments are now using their resources to collect information about ordinary civillians on a global scale, posing a direct threat to the privacy and security of our daily lives.

As a result of public concern in response to these new dangers, we are now witnessing an unprecedented level of effort to develop communication systems emphasising security and privacy. In particular, there has been a major push to develop secure Internet messengers which would allow people to communicate freely, without fear of being targeted by either malicious individuals or state surveillance programmes. The author of this dissertation feels great respect for these endeavors and firmly believes that having a private conversation is a fundamental right of any human being. He therefore regards this work as his own modest contribution to the noble cause of protecting humanity from the cyber-threats it is facing today.

The aim of this project has been to produce an implementation of KleeQ, a peer-to-peer conversation security protocol designed for devices with limited connectivity, and evaluate its performance and practicality in the broader context of Internet messaging. The intention has been to preserve the security guarantees of the original design as well as understand its limitations that could potentially be used as attack vectors. It was also been expected that a useable prototype of a messaging application would be produced, to evaluate the usability implications of the design as well as demonstrate the work of the implementation.
